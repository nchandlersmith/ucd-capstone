# Backend
Picking is up after much time since I was working on it last.
Things are a bit of a mess. All the unit tests pass.
Two integration tests fail.

## Running the integration tests
1. Go to the backend directory
2. Run `serverless-offline start`
3. Go to the integration-tests directory
4. Run `npm run test`
